# Discord Tracker

Hello World Initial Project

## Ideas on what to do

- Maybe like a bot that records everything in every channel that happens in a discord server and log it into a db. we can then use this information to make a graph db and display like connections on how many times someone has talked to someone else or something? I was thinking about putting this bot into a server passively to collect data and create a graph on lol.

- Since we are thinking about doing a scalable application using container management software I would recommend for us to use [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) at first to get our feet wet. If there is opposition to using kubernetes there are other alternatives that do not have as much overhead to learn to get started. Other options include [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), or [nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) and prob more but I just didnt look them
