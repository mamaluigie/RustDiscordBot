## Ideas on what to do

- Maybe like a bot that records everything in every channel that happens in a discord server and log it into a db. we can then use this information to make a graph db and display like connections on how many times someone has talked to someone else or something? I was thinking about putting this bot into a server passively to collect data and create a graph on lol.
