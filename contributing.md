# Contributions

To contribute just create a new branch and make a pull request into the main branch. There is a required 1 person to accept the pull request for it to be merged for right now. We can change this number as needed.

Later on we can have like rules for making pull requests that include adding a certain ammount of information in the pull request for what and why the request is being made. Like we can make a pull request template or something.
